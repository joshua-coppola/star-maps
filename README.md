# About

----------
This is the web backend for @joshua-coppola's Ski-Trail-Ratings project, and all svg and csv files are from that repository. This repository should be placed in the same directory at the same level as Ski-Trail-Ratings. This portion of the project creates the database tables, found in schema.sql, and passes the needed information to the front-end.

## Todo

As things currently stand, most pages exist and work, but small tweaks need to be made. This document will be updated to reflect progress and what is left to complete once that is fully established.
